Low Cost Bi-Directional Level Shift Module Characterization (TE291)

From time to time the level shift module pictured above has come in handy.  
They do a great job shifting 3.3VDC to 5VDC logic or 5VDC logic to 3.3VDC logic.  
The cost is about $1USD and hookup is simple.  
Of course they are designed for low speed digital signals but, we wondered how the module would handle higher speeds.
